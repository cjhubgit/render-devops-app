# Portfolio DevOps Project

This project demonstrates my skills in deploying and automating a Python application using the following:

1. **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for managing code.
2. **Deployment Framework**: Render for hosting the application.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated workflows using GitHub Actions.
4. **Python Framework**: Flask for creating the application.
