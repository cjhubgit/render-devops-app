*Automating Application Deployment with CI/CD*

**Objective**
This project focuses on setting up and implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of a Python Flask application. The deployment is done on the Render cloud platform, showcasing how automation can streamline application updates and hosting.

1. **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for managing code.
2. **Deployment Framework**: Render for hosting the application.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated workflows using GitHub Actions.
4. **Python Framework**: Flask for creating the application.

**Render Cloud platform Deployment Process**

This process outlines how the application is deployed and hosted on the Render cloud platform as part of the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Build Initialization**
1.1 When a push is made to the main branch, the Render platform is triggered to start the deployment process.
1.2 The platform begins by setting up the build environment using the applicationâ€™s linked repository (e.g., GitHub).

**GitHub Actions dashboard**

**Function**

This shows the GitHub Actions dashboard where the CI/CD workflow (Test CI/CD Pipeline) is defined and triggered.
**It lists**
Workflow name
Test CI/CD pipeline.
**Status**
In progress (or other states like "Success" or "Failed").
**Branch** 
main
**Process**

Whenever a new commit is pushed to the main branch, this workflow is triggered automatically.
The workflow contains defined steps like setting up Python, installing dependencies, and deploying to Render.

**Key Takeaway for Portfolio**

This screenshot demonstrates the CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions, which automatically triggers workflows based on code changes.

This screen shot is  live application reflects the outcome of the automated CI/CD pipeline, 
showcasing successful deployment and hosting on Render.

**Function**

This is the final result of the CI/CD pipeline: the deployed application accessible via the Render-hosted URL (render-devops-app.onrender)
The web page confirms that the application is live and functional.

**Process**
Once the deployment is successful on Render, the application becomes publicly accessible.
The URL provided by Render can be used to access the application.

 **Error logs in action github action**
 <img src= "Error Logs in GitHub Actions.png" alt width= "550">

 **Function**

This shows an error encountered during a failed GitHub Actions workflow.
The error (curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL) occurred during the Deploy to Render step.

**Process**
The error happened because of an incorrect or missing URL in the curl command used for deployment.

**Steps taken to resolve the error**
Identified the issue in the logs.
Corrected the URL in the deploy.yml file to ensure the proper API endpoint was used.
Re-ran the workflow after making the fix.

**Key Takeaway for Portfolio**

Encountered and resolved deployment errors by debugging logs in GitHub Actions. The fix involved correcting the API endpoint in the deployment configuration.

**Successful CI/CD Pipeline**

**Function**

This shows a successful run of the CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions.
All steps (Setup Job, Checkout Code, Set up Python, Install Dependencies, Deploy to Render) are marked as completed.

**Process**
After fixing the error in the previous step, the pipeline was re-run, leading to a successful deployment.
Each step in the workflow is executed without any errors.

**Key Takeaway for Portfolio**
This screenshot demonstrates a successful CI/CD pipeline run, highlighting the automated workflow's efficiency and reliability.
